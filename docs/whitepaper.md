# Shruti AI Gurukul Whitepaper v1.2

## Abstract
Free, oral learning on X, powered by Grok AI, rooted in Vedic *Akasha*. Validates recitations (95% accuracy) to fight ignorance/corruption. GKT rewards learners; X OS integration for global equity.

## Vedic Akasha
*Akasha*, the cosmic ether, holds eternal truth. Shruti AI captures *Shruti* (oral wisdom) via X, with Grok verifying facts (e.g., anti-pollution truths). Device-agnostic, itâ€™s *Akasha* reborn for Earthlings.

## Problem
Costly education excludes oral learners. Corruption (e.g., toxic crackers) thrives on ignorance.

## Solution
- Voice input on X; Grok checks facts/retention.
- Free, sustainable; GKT funds eco-donations (clean air).
- X OS for phones/IoT.

## Tech Stack
- AI: Grok-4 API (speech-to-text, validation).
- Software: Python voice processor; GKT contract.
- Platform: X app/X OS.

## Tokenomics
1B GKT: 40% community, 20% philanthropy. Rewards: 10 GKT/recitation.

## Roadmap
- Q2 2026: X app beta.
- Q4 2026: X OS.
- 2027: Multilingual.
