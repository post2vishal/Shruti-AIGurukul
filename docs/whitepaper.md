# Shruti AI Gurukul Whitepaper v1.1

## Abstract
Shruti AI Gurukul: Free, oral learning on X, powered by Grok AI. Validates recitations (95% accuracy) to fight ignorance/corruption. GKT rewards learners; X OS integration for global equity.

## Problem
Costly education excludes oral learners. Corruption thrives in ignorance. YouTubeâ€™s noise buries truth.

## Solution
- Voice input on X; Grok checks facts/retention.
- Free, device-agnostic; GKT for eco-donations (e.g., clean air funds).
- Sustainable: No resource-heavy curricula.

## Tech Stack
- AI: Grok-4 API (speech-to-text, validation).
- Software: Python voice processor; GKT contract.
- Platform: X app/X OS.

## Tokenomics
1B GKT: 40% community, 20% philanthropy (e.g., anti-pollution). Rewards: 10 GKT/recitation.

## Roadmap
- Q2 2026: X app beta.
- Q4 2026: X OS rollout.
- 2027: Multilingual (Hindi, Tamil).
