Update: Grok-Inspired Open-Source Projects Now Live (MIT, No Affiliation)

Hi xAI Team,

Quick update: I've published 3 small, non-commercial, MIT-licensed projects inspired by Grok's helpful spirit:

- [Optimus-BioETongue]  – Enzyme taste analysis
- [Shruti-AIGurukul] – Free oral education for Earthlings
- [GrokKarmaToken] – Karma rewards for Humanity 2.0

All include clear disclaimers: *“Not affiliated with xAI.”*  
No crypto, no sales, no confusion.

If any naming causes concern, I’ll rename in 24 hrs—no ego.  
Otherwise, I’ll keep building for good.

Grateful for your work.
